# Bank-Management-Project
This is a desktop-based application developed using Java and MySQL to handle basic banking operations like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and transaction history. It uses JDBC for database connectivity and ensures secure, real-time data updates. The system is ideal for learning OOP, CRUD operations, and Java-SQL integration.
Bank Management System (Java + MySQL)

🔷 Project Description:
The Bank Management System is a simple and secure desktop-based application developed using Java for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end database. The project is designed to manage basic banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, balance inquiries, and transaction history management.

This system ensures data integrity and provides an interactive GUI (Swing/JavaFX) or CLI (Command Line Interface) to allow users and bank staff to perform banking operations efficiently.

🔷 Key Features:
🏦 Create Account – Add new customer accounts with personal and banking details.

💰 Deposit Funds – Update the customer's balance by depositing money.

💸 Withdraw Funds – Withdraw a specific amount with proper validation.

📊 Balance Enquiry – Show the current available balance of a customer.

📜 Transaction History – Track deposits and withdrawals by date and time.

🔐 User Authentication – Admin login system to secure access to operations.

🗑️ Delete/Close Account – Remove an existing customer account.

🛠️ Update Account Info – Edit customer details (like phone, address, etc.).

🔷 Technologies Used:
Frontend: Java (Swing / JavaFX or CLI using Scanner & System.out)

Backend: Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Database: MySQL

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

Version Control: Git (optional)

🔷 Database Design (MySQL):
Tables used:

accounts – Stores customer account details (account_number, name, phone, balance, etc.)

transactions – Records all deposit/withdraw transactions with timestamps.

users – (Optional) For admin login details.

🔷 Project Goals:
To demonstrate understanding of OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

To practice Java-SQL integration using JDBC.

To build a mini real-world simulation of a banking environment.

To enhance skills in database design, CRUD operations, and user interaction design.

🔷 Future Improvements (Optional):
Add online banking features (web version using JSP/Servlets or Spring Boot).

Implement encryption/security (e.g., password hashing, OTP).

Integrate report generation (PDF or Excel).

Add SMS/email notifications for transactions.
